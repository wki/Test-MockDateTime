=head1 NAME

Test::MockDateTime - mock DateTime->now calls during tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More;
    use Test::MockDateTime;
    use DateTime;
    
    on '2013-01-02 03:04:05' => sub {
        # inside this block all calls to DateTime::now 
        # will report a mocked date.
        
        my $now = DateTime->now;
        is $now->ymd, '2013-01-02', 'occured now';
    };
    
    done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Getting the current time sometimes is not very helpful for testing scenarios.
Instead, if you could obtain a known value during the runtime of a testcase
will make your results predictable.

Why another Date Mocker? I wanted something simple with a very concise usage
pattern and a mocked date should only exist and stay constant inside a scope.
After leaving the scope the current time should be back. This lead to this
tiny module.

This simple module allows faking a given date and time for the runtime of
a subsequent code block. By default the C<on> keyword is exported into the
namespace of the test file. The date to get mocked must be in a format that
is recognized by L<DateTime::Format::DateParse|DateTime::Format::DateParse>.

    on '2013-01-02 03:04:05', sub { ... };

is basically the same as

    {
        my $now = DateTime::Format::DateParse->parse_datetime(
            '2013-01-02 03:04:05'
        );
        
        local *DateTime::now = sub { $now->clone };
        
        ... everything from code block above
    }

A drawback when relying on this module is that you must know that the module
you are testing uses C<<< DateTime->now >>> to obtain the current time.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut

=head2 on $date_and_time, \&code

mocks date and time and then executes code

=cut

sub on {
    my ($date, $code) = @_;

    my $now = DateTime::Format::DateParse->parse_datetime($date);

    no warnings 'redefine';
    local *DateTime::now = sub { $now->clone };

    $code->();
}

=head1 CAVEATS

This module only mocks calls to C<<< DateTime->now >>>. All other ways to
obtain a current time are not touched.

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are some alternatives. Depending on the environment you might consider
using one of them instead.

=over

=item L<Test::MockTime|Test::MockTime>

Very universal, overwrites several subs at compile time and allows to set
a fixed or ticking time at any place in your code.

=item L<Time::Mock|Time::Mock>

Also allows to set a time at various places inside your code.

=item L<Test::MockTime::DateCalc|Test::MockTime::DateCalc>

Mocks serveral L<Date::Calc|Date::Calc> functions.

=item L<Time::Fake|Time::Fake>

Also overwrites several subs at compile time.
